# =================================================================
# I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) Bus Configuration
# =================================================================
# This configuration enables I2C bus support for sensor communication
# and device control in robotics applications.
#
# Common I2C devices in robotics:
# - IMU sensors (MPU6050, BMI160, LSM9DS1)
# - Environmental sensors (BME280, SHT30, BMP180)
# - Distance sensors (VL53L0X, VL6180X time-of-flight)
# - Display modules (OLED, LCD with I2C backpack)
# - Real-time clocks (DS1307, PCF8523)
# - IO expanders (PCF8574, MCP23017)
# - ADC/DAC converters (ADS1115, MCP4725)
#
# I2C Bus characteristics:
# - Multi-master, multi-slave bus
# - Typical speeds: 100kHz (standard), 400kHz (fast), 1MHz (fast+)
# - 7-bit or 10-bit device addressing
# - Only 2 wires needed: SDA (data) and SCL (clock)

# Core I2C subsystem - enables the I2C bus infrastructure
CONFIG_I2C=y

# I2C character device support - provides /dev/i2c-X devices
# Allows userspace applications to communicate directly with I2C devices
CONFIG_I2C_CHARDEV=y

# I2C board info support - enables static device registration
# Used for devices defined in device tree or board files
CONFIG_I2C_BOARDINFO=y

# I2C compatibility layer - maintains backward compatibility
# Ensures older I2C drivers continue to work
CONFIG_I2C_COMPAT=y

# Automatic I2C helper loading - automatically loads helper modules
# Simplifies I2C subsystem initialization and device detection
CONFIG_I2C_HELPER_AUTO=y

# Bit-banging I2C algorithm - software-based I2C implementation
# Fallback for platforms without hardware I2C controllers
# Also used by some GPIO-based I2C implementations
CONFIG_I2C_ALGOBIT=y

# OMAP I2C driver - hardware I2C controller for BeagleBone Black
# Supports the AM335x processor's built-in I2C controllers (I2C0, I2C1, I2C2)
# Provides hardware-accelerated I2C communication with interrupt support
CONFIG_I2C_OMAP=y
